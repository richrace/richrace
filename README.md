### Hi I’m Rich 👋

I’m a Software Engineer and I have the unfortunate pleasure of being host to a brain tumour 🧠 (WHO Grade II Oligodendroglioma).

I ❤️ web technologies & my open source projects.

I currently work for Made Tech as a Lead Software Engineer. If you’re curious, you can read what my role entails via our open source [handbook](https://github.com/madetech/handbook/blob/main/roles/).
